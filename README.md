# Tea Shop - Simple e-commerce website
### Live version: [Tea Shop](https://shoptea.netlify.app)

I've coded this website for a simple purpose - to dive deeper into React!

For now:
- items can be added,substract and deleted from the shopping basket
- searching through diffrent teas
- items added to the cart are stored in the session storage
- purchase notification
- simple purchase form(it doesn't do much actually)

#### Technologies:
- React
- React Hooks
- Sass


#####  TO-DO:
- prettier styling
- fetching items from the api
- extend purchase form (simple backend?)

###### Work still in progress
